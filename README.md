# 🚧 Take Care of Your Bias (Work in Progress)

> ⚠️ This project is currently under active development.

## 📌 Description

Take Care of Your Bias is a wholesome pet simulator game with a fun twist! Instead of caring for a typical pet, you’ll be looking after your P-pop bias. Inspired by SB19 and created especially for fellow A'TIN fans, the available characters are the SB19 members themselves.

In the game, you can feed your bias, help him get enough rest, and keep him happy throughout the day. Customize your home to reflect your style or your bias’s personality, earn coins from unexpected events, and use those coins to buy clothes and accessories to dress him up.

Enjoy nurturing your favorite idol and making your virtual space uniquely yours!
